# Zen

[![GitHub release (latest)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/Maxymillion/zen?style=flat-square&sort=semver)](https://github.com/Maxymillion/zen/releases/latest)

A focus mode Obsidian plugin. Inspired by "iA Writer". Sometimes you need to remove all distractions, or at least a few. What if you could just disable elements on a whim?

## Instructions
After installing the plugin you can quite easily change the "hidden items" from the settings tab.

### (Optional) Install beta using [Obsidian42 - BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat)
1. Install BRAT from the Community Plugins in Obsidian.
2. Open the command palette and run the command BRAT: Add a beta plugin for testing.
3. Paste this repo's link into the pop-up.
	a. `https://github.com/Maxymillion/zen`.
4. Click on Add Plugin -- wait a few seconds and BRAT will tell you what is going on.
5. After BRAT confirms the installation, in Settings go to the **Community plugins ** tab.
6. Refresh the Community plugins list.
7. Enable the **Zen** plugin.
8. If you do find any bugs, please report them [here](https://github.com/Maxymillion/zen/issues).

### Options - Highlights
Sometimes those names can be quite convoluted, hold the eye button next to the toggle to get a glimpse of which element you will be hiding.

## Credits
Based on the [Asana Sync](https://github.com/Maxymillion/asana-sync-plugin) codebase.

## Integration
This plugin works perfectly with my other plugin, [Simple font-size controls](https://github.com/Maxymillion/simple-font-size-controls) which allows you to use the `CMD/CTRL` and `=` or `-` key to only increase the font size of the editor instead of the complete UI.
